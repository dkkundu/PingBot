## Project Summary: Notification_Application

This document summarizes the changes made to the `Notification_Application` project and its current status.

### Project Overview

The project is a Flask-based application designed for sending notifications, including integration with Telegram via an external API. It utilizes Celery for background tasks and Flask-SQLAlchemy for database interactions.

### Changes Made

During this session, the following significant changes and refactorings were performed:

1.  **`requirements.txt` Update:**
    *   Added missing core dependencies: `celery`, `redis`, `python-dotenv`, `pytz`, `requests` with specific version numbers for better reproducibility.

2.  **Celery Configuration & Tasks:**
    *   **`app/celery_worker.py`:** Updated the Celery Beat schedule to correctly call `app.notification_sender.tasks.check_scheduled_alerts` (from the previous `send_alert_background_task_process`).
    *   **`app/notification_sender/tasks.py`:** Refactored and cleaned up, removing commented-out code and ensuring `send_alert_task` and `check_scheduled_alerts` are well-defined with improved logging and error handling.

3.  **Application Structure & Configuration:**
    *   **`app/app.py`:** Its content (the `create_app` function) was moved to `app/__init__.py` for better project structure, and the file was cleared with a comment indicating the move.
    *   **`app/__init__.py`:** Now contains the `create_app` function, `ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS` configuration for file uploads, and updated blueprint imports.

4.  **Database Model & Migrations:**
    *   **`app/notification_sender/models.py`:** The `body` column in the `AlertSample` model was changed from `db.Text` to `db.Text(length=4294967295)` to map to MySQL's `LONGTEXT` type, allowing for much larger content (e.g., base64 encoded images).
    *   **Database Migration Process:** Guided through resetting the migration history (deleting `migrations` folder and `alembic_version` table manually) and then re-initializing (`flask db init`), creating (`flask db migrate`), and applying (`flask db upgrade`) a new migration to incorporate the `LONGTEXT` change.

5.  **Route Refactoring (Reverted):**
    *   Initially, routes were moved from `auth_frontend.py` and `alert_views.py` into new `urls.py` files within their respective modules. This change was **subsequently reverted** as per user request.
    *   **`app/authentication/urls.py`:** Created and then removed.
    *   **`app/notification_sender/urls.py`:** Created and then removed.
    *   **`app/authentication/views/auth_frontend.py`:** Restored to contain all its original routes. File upload paths within this file were updated to use `current_app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER']` and `ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS` for consistency.
    *   **`app/notification_sender/views/alert_views.py`:** Restored to contain all its original routes.
    *   **`app/authentication/urls.py` (old, commented out):** Removed.
    *   **`app/notification_sender/views/__init__.py`:** Removed, as it was entirely commented out and unused.

### Current Status

From the perspective of the Python codebase, the project is now in a much cleaner, more organized, and robust state. All identified internal code issues have been addressed, and the project structure is more conventional.

### Outstanding Issues & Next Steps for User

There are two primary issues that require user intervention, as they cannot be resolved directly through code changes by the agent:

1.  **Persistent `Data too long for column 'body'` Error:**
    *   **Problem:** This error indicates that the `body` column in the `alert_sample` table in your MySQL database is *still* not `LONGTEXT`, despite the model change and migration attempts. The agent cannot directly verify your database schema.
    *   **Crucial Next Step:** You *must* directly verify the schema of the `alert_sample` table in your MySQL database. Connect using a MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, or the `mysql` command-line client) and run:
        ```sql
        DESCRIBE alert_sample;
        -- OR --
        SHOW CREATE TABLE alert_sample;
        ```
        **Provide the full output of this command.** This is the only way to confirm if the `LONGTEXT` change has been applied.

2.  **`404 Client Error: Not Found` for Telegram API:**
    *   **Problem:** This error indicates that the external Telegram API endpoint (`BOT_GROUP_API`) your application is trying to reach is either incorrect or inaccessible. This is an external configuration/infrastructure issue.
    *   **Next Steps:**
        *   **Verify `BOT_GROUP_API`:** Double-check the URL in your `.env` file for typos. It must be the *exact* URL provided by your external Telegram API service.
        *   **Check External Service Status:** Ensure the external API service itself is running and accessible from where your application is hosted. If using `ngrok`, confirm the `ngrok` tunnel is active and correctly configured.
        *   **Consult API Documentation:** Confirm the correct endpoint path (e.g., `/send-message-group`) with your external Telegram API's documentation.

### Running the Application for Testing

Once you have addressed the above outstanding issues, please run these commands in **three separate terminal windows** in your project's root directory (`/home/osman/SSL Wireless/readyy/26-08(4.03pm)/12.13/Notification_Application`).

**Terminal 1: Start the Celery Worker**

```bash
venv/bin/celery -A app.celery_config worker -l info
```

**Terminal 2: Start Celery Beat**

```bash
venv/bin/celery -A app.celery_config beat -l info
```

**Terminal 3: Start the Flask Application**

```bash
python run.py
```

After all three are running, try creating a new alert in your Flask application that is configured to send a message to a Telegram group. Then, provide the complete output from all three terminals for further diagnosis.
